# Hackschool Resources - Fall 2017

## Welcome to Hackschool 

It's easy to feel lost in the world of tech or not know where to start. We
created Hackschool to give you a place to start in this wonderful universe of
possibilities. We wanted to fill the gaps between what is taught in class and
what is needed to build change you'd like to see in the world. Over the next 8
weeks, we'll alternate between Learn and Hack sessions, where we'll introduce a
new topic with mentors on-hand to help, and then spend the following week
building out a mini-project to apply it. By the end, you'll have glimpsed a
little bit of everything behind the websites you visit every day.

In this repository, you'll find a guidemap to all the topics we introduce this
quarter, and links to helpful resources.

We hope you have a blast this quarter, and encourage you to reach out to any of
us if you have any questions or comments. Private concerns can be addressed to
the current Hackschool Director, Shannon Phu, at
[skphu@ucla.edu](mailto:skphu@ucla.edu).

## Basic Curriculum

Each week, we will alternate between "Learn" and "Hack" sessions. During Learn sessions, students will be taught new material and follow along with our instructors in writing some basic code. During Hack sessions, students will apply the knowledge gained from the previous teach session to build a project that we will guide you in making.

## What You'll Need for the Entire Course

* A positive attitude. We'll encounter plenty of frustration along the way, 
  but that makes the later joy all the better.

* A text editor. We recommend [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as
  a default choice, but [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
  [Atom](https://atom.io/) are also excellent choices. If you already use
  another editor, that's perfectly fine. Don't worry about using the "best"
  one; any modern editor is more than enough for what we'll tackle this
  quarter.

* Google Chrome: it has the best developer tools and the most market share of
  any web browser

Bonus items (if you have time; these are not needed for frontend web development): 

* Create a GitHub account

* If you're on a Mac, you may later run into issues where software is missing.
  To prevent this, install Xcode from the App Store. Then run `xcode-select --install` in Terminal. This will install command-line tools that we'll need
  later on. Here's a [tutorial with screenshots](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)

* Download and install the LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
  We don't recommend using the latest version because of how quickly new Node
  versions are introducing, often leading to unexpected breakages when the
  newest version is incompatible with other code you're using.

* (Advanced) If you're on a Mac, you'll eventually want
  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage installing command-line tools and
  [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage different versions of Node.js.

### Helpful Docs & Tools

* [http://jsbin.com/](http://jsbin.com/) for quick in-browser prototypes

* [Mancy](https://github.com/princejwesley/Mancy) if you want an interactive
  JavaScript prompt (called a REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)

* [http://codepen.io/](http://codepen.io/) to share ideas with other people

* You'll find the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) very helpful
for looking up the particulars of a built-in function or CSS property.

* [Modern JavaScript Cheatsheet](https://github.com/mbeaudru/modern-js-cheatsheet/blob/master/readme.md)


### Learning Beyond Hackschool

* [A Reintroduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) if you've touched JS a bit before

* [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) for a free 30-day series of daily
  mini-projects

* [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) to learn the language more deeply
